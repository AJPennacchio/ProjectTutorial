There are a number of ways to run this R script (BoxPlotTutorial.R), but I recommend using R Studio (which requires downloading R). The code uses various R libraries, which you may need to install. R Studio will alert you which libraries have not been installed yet and will ask if you want to install them. 

After all the proper libraries have been installed, you will need to make sure they are loaded in properly. Load the libraries in sequentially before attempting to run any of the code producing plots. After loading the libraries and the dataset, you should be able to visualize each plot by running the code.
